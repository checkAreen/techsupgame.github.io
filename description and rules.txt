You're playing for the random Technical Support Agent in a random IT company.
Everyday you receive a huge amount of requests from your customers.

Press "Z" to fix a tech issue, and press "C" to scream "Not a tech question" to pass this request to another department.
But be careful, your boss can fire you.
That's all!

Enjoy :)
