In this browser game you'll play for a random agent of technical support department in a random IT company. Everyday you receive a huge amount of requests from your customers.  Press "Z" to fix a tech issue, and press "C" to scream "Not a tech question" to pass this request to another department. But be careful, your boss can fire you.
